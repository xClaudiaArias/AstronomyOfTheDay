        <p>Hello! My name is Claudia. I am a software developer and I created this page just for fun. I love NASA and always check <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">APOD's official page</a> so I wanted to create something similar but a bit more simple, of course.</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy this page.</p>
